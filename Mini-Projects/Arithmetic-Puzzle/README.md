This script is to implement a python application of an arithmetic puzzle and its solution.  

User is given six numbers, five of which are between 1 and 10, and the last one is from among 25, 50, 75, 100. He is supposed to find a three-digit number performing arithmetic operations on any of these given numbers but using only once and with no float result in 60 seconds.  

The program keeps the time and finally returns the solution as follows:  

```
The numbers given to solve are: (3, 5, 6, 8, 10, 50)

The number you have to find is: 264 

You have 60 seconds to solve the problem

Your time has started! Good luck!

Here is the solution:
 
 Sum 6 and 8 = 14.  
 Subtract 5 from 10 = 5.  
 Multiply 5 with 50 = 250.  
 Sum 14 and 250 = 264. 

The closest number is: 264 different from the target number by 0
